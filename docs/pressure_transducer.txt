The pressure transducer is the 200psi WALFRONT 1pc 1/8NPT Thread Stainless Steel Pressure Transducer from Walmart. 
On Feb 23, 2022 it was $20.52. This transducer produces an analog signal from 10% to 90% or the input voltage. Without
calibration data, I assumed a linear relationship (0.33v = 0psi, 2.97v = 200psi). Since the pico has a 12 bit adc,
this translates to a reading of 410 at 0psi and 3686 at 200psi. Interpulating linearlly, this leads to the following
relationship

PSI = 0.06105*(x-410)

where x is the reading from the pico's adc. Early, unscientific tests where I blew into the pressure sensor produced a
reading of 1-2psi. This is the pressure an average human can create so at least I know it moves in the right direction
and is in the correct order of magnitude. This can be converted to bars resulting in the following repationship

BAR = 0.00420925*(x-410)

I think the raw adc readings will be transmitted from the pico to the host pi and the conversion can be handeled there.
